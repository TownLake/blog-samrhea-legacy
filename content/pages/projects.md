This blog is home to the output of four different projects:

## 🗺️ Walkthroughs

I enjoy learning new things and writing [detailed, step-by-step, tutorials](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough/).

## 🇵🇹 Portugal

I live in Portugal and I jot down stories about [life here](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/portugal/). Sometimes I share anecdotes about growing up in [Texas](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/texas/).

## ⚙️ Productivity

I also write about [how I work](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/productivity/). I publish these posts for no other reason than my own sentimental reflection about decisions I made in the past.
