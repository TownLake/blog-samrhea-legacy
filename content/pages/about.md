Hi there. My name is Sam and I use this blog to (mostly) write step-by-step walkthroughs on topics ranging from [serverless blogging](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/migrate-blog-to-workers) to [buying a phone plan abroad](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/switching-country-phones). I like to learn how to do things, write down what I learned, and share those notes here.

I also write about goofy stories about life in [Texas](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/texas) or [Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/portugal).

I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown in 2019 to [move to Lisbon, Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/one-year-lisbon) and help open Cloudflare's office here. [We're hiring!](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?department=default&location=Lisbon,%20Portugal)

I'm the [VP of Product](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samrhea/) at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for our [Zero Trust products](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/zero-trust-network-access/). The Cloudflare Zero Trust suite helps teams of any size stay safe without slowing them down.

I’m probably busy right now using a spreadsheet for a hobby project that doesn’t need one. Or walking a dog we named after the second-worst highway in Austin, Mopac.
