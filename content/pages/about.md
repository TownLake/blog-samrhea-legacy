Hi there. My name is Sam and I use this blog to (mostly) write step-by-step walkthroughs on topics ranging from [serverless blogging](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/migrate-blog-to-workers) to [buying a phone plan abroad](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/switching-country-phones). I like to learn how to do things, I like to write down how I did it, and I publish those notes here.

I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown in 2019 to move to Lisbon, Portugal.

I'm also a [Director of Product](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samrhea/) at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), where I work on [products](https://teams.cloudflare.com/) that help solve security problems. You can learn more about what I do [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/at-cloudflare).

I’m probably busy right now using a spreadsheet for a hobby project that doesn’t need one. Or walking a dog we named after the second-worst highway in Austin, Mopac.
