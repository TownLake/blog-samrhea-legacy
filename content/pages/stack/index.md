## Reading

I find it valuable to document where I am getting my news in different phases. This diet influences so much of how I see the world.

I am the most religious about _The Economist_. I read that weekly, in print, without fail. I like the depth of their articles and I think the slight delay is useful. Nothing that CNN thinks of as "Breaking News" has any real or immediate impact on my life. Short of war breaking out on the Iberian Peninsula or a financial collapse, very few news stories simply cannot wait. What am I supposed to do with something like the "Takeaways from Day 8 of the Trump Trial" - the current CNN headline - on a Saturday morning? I'd rather the journalists at _The Economist_ lean into the constraint of a weekly print publication and gather and analyze the news.

I do need to do a better job of consuming Portuguese local news. That kind of thing has both impact and urgency in my life. Right now my primary source of Portuguese news consumption is my wife relaying the news to me, in English, that she read in Portuguese while we wind down at night. Like some kind of old timey radio broadcast called _Here's what happened today in Portugal today that Sam might care about_.

## Things I don't have

* Facebook - I did love it once upon a time. I am definitely married to my wife thanks to it. At some point in 2017 or 2018 I decided it was a bit too much and deleted it. I don't miss it.
* TikTok
