I work on the Emerging Technology and Incubation team at Cloudflare. We ship the future that we think our customers will need months and years from now.

I previously spent six years launching, building, and leading the [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) business at Cloudflare as the VP of Product. I ran the enterprise security use cases of [Cloudflare One](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-one-year-later/) and the proprietary private networking components.

I [launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/) the first prototype in this group into GA as a Product Manager in 2018. A few years later we became the [only new vendor in the Gartner Magic Quadrant](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant/) and then made the biggest leap the [year after that](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant-2024). From the [US Federal Government](https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-keep-governments-safe-and-secure/) to [Fortune 500 companies](https://cloudflare.tv/shows/connect/keynote-how-roche-is-adopting-zero-trust-principles/0ZbDrlvM) to start-ups on our [free plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/zero-trust-services/), tens of thousands of teams trust us to keep their operations safe without compromising on performance.

The SASE business is now led by a brilliant team that joined me on that journey. They are building something bigger and better than I could have ever imagined. Meanwhile, I've jumped back to the lab to help figure out what's next.

I also [launched our Registrar](https://blog.cloudflare.com/using-cloudflare-registrar/) years ago and miss the bizarre dance of domain registration. I'm sorry -- I do not know when we will support the `.horse` TLD.

## 2018 - Product Manager of Access and Registrar

I joined Cloudflare as a Product Manager in our Research & Development wing, what we now call Emerging Technology and Incubation. [Launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/) Cloudflare Access to help teams turn off their legacy VPN. [Launched](https://blog.cloudflare.com/using-cloudflare-registrar/) Cloudflare Registrar to provide customers with at-cost domain registration.

## 2019 - PM of Access, Registrar, and Tunnel

Customers liked Access, but they wanted more. We added workflows that sat outside of a traditional browser so we introduced support for [SSH](https://blog.cloudflare.com/releasing-the-cloudflare-access-feature-that-let-us-smash-a-vpn-on-stage[), [service tokens](https://blog.cloudflare.com/give-your-automated-services-credentials-with-access-service-tokens), [command line flows](https://blog.cloudflare.com/leave-your-vpn-and-curl-secure-apis-with-cloudflare-access), and [RDP](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-supports-rdp).

I also became the Product Manager of Cloudflare Tunnel, our private networking toolkit. [We made it free](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-free-argo-tunnel-for-your-next-project) to give more organizations secure ways to connect.

Meanwhile, we realized that DNSSEC is hard but we could make it seamless. We shipped [one-click DNSSEC](https://blog.cloudflare.com/one-click-dnssec-with-cloudflare-registrar) to all Registrar customers at no cost. I handed off Registrar to an expert Product Manager that we added to the team so that I could focus on what was becoming the Zero Trust portfolio.

## 2020 - Director of Product for Cloudflare Zero Trust

COVID accelerated the timeline for many of our customers to migrate away from their legacy security and networking models. We ran a [free program](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-week-setting-up-cloudflare-one-as-a-small-business) for teams to onboard. Dozens of employees from all departments signed up to guide organizations.

We also had to ship faster. Teams could bring [multiple identity providers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/multi-sso-and-cloudflare-access-adding-linkedin-and-github-teams/), [control](https://blog.cloudflare.com/releasing-cloudflare-access-most-requested-feature/) providers by application, require [hard keys](https://blog.cloudflare.com/require-hard-key-auth-with-cloudflare-access/), [manage the regions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/two-clicks-to-enable-regional-zero-trust-compliance/) in use, deploy [long-lived](https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnels-that-live-forever/) private networks, and send users to an [app launcher](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-the-cloudflare-access-app-launch/).

We extended Zero Trust [control to SaaS apps](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-for-saas/
), too, and I got to be part of a team that was [awarded the patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11394710?trk=public_profile_patent-button) for it. At this point the Zero Trust business had grown from just an access control product to a portfolio and we [retooled to reflect that](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-single-dashboard-for-cloudflare-for-teams/
).

I also ran out of time in 2020

I spend every day working with curious, empathetic product managers and product directors in my group who obsess over how we can use Cloudflare's network to solve security problems for teams of any size.

Back in the day, I was a Product Manager for most of the products above or the Director of Product when Product Managers  smarter than me built those tools. I consider myself terribly lucky to have worked with brilliant teammates to watch these prototypes and moon shot ideas evolve into Cloudflare's next act. I could not be more excited to see what we can solve next for our customers.

I also [launched our Registrar](https://blog.cloudflare.com/using-cloudflare-registrar/) years ago and miss the bizarre dance of domain registration. I'm sorry -- I do not know when we will support the `.horse` TLD.
