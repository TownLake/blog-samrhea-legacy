Hi there. My name is Sam. I’m probably busy right now using a spreadsheet for a hobby project that doesn’t need one. Or [walking a dog](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/a-serra-and-new-friends) we named after the second-worst highway in Austin, Mopac.

## Blog

I like to learn how to do things, write down what I learned, and share those notes [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough/). However, I spend more time lately writing goofy stories about growing up in in [Texas](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/texas) or living in [Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/portugal).

## Austin -> Lisbon

I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown in 2019 to help open Cloudflare's office in [Lisbon, Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/one-year-lisbon). What was supposed to be a one year assignment has evolved into an open-ended tenure for me and my family. We like it here and I think you would too - [we're hiring!](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?location=Lisbon%2C+Portugal)

## Work

I work on the Emerging Technology and Incubation team at Cloudflare. We ship the future that we think our customers will need months and years from now.

I previously spent six years launching, building, and leading the [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) [product line](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-one-year-later/) at Cloudflare as the VP of Product.

I [shipped](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-access-now-teams-of-any-size-can-turn-off-their-vpn/) the first prototype in this group into GA as a Product Manager in 2018. We only moved faster after that. A few years later we became the [only new vendor in the Gartner Magic Quadrant](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant/) and then made the biggest leap the [year following](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-sse-gartner-magic-quadrant-2024). From the [US Federal Government](https://blog.cloudflare.com/helping-keep-governments-safe-and-secure/) to [Fortune 500 companies](https://cloudflare.tv/shows/connect/keynote-how-roche-is-adopting-zero-trust-principles/0ZbDrlvM) to start-ups on our [free plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/zero-trust-services/), tens of thousands of teams trust us to keep their organizations safe.

The SASE business is now led by the brilliant team that joined me on that journey. They are building something bigger and better than I could have ever imagined. Meanwhile, I've been sent back to the lab to help figure out what's next.

I also [launched our Registrar](https://blog.cloudflare.com/using-cloudflare-registrar/) years ago and miss the bizarre dance of domain registration. I'm sorry -- I do not know when we will support the `.horse` TLD.

Before Cloudflare I spent several years as a Product Manager in the Austin office of ESW Capital. I helped acquire and improve software companies of all sizes through our DevFactory arm. Prior to my time with the ESW Capital group I worked for a medical technology investment firm doing a little bit of everything as we built, bought, and invested in healthcare technology businesses.

## School

I studied in the [Plan II Program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/plan2/) at The University of Texas at Austin. Yes, it is a major in and of itself.

My diploma doesn't matter at all, though. Where we went to school _maybe_ impacts our first job. I bring it up here because I loved Plan II and think you would, too. The admittedly weird curriculum seems well-equipped to prepare students for whatever oddball form the future will take. I was able to serve on the Board of Visitors before I moved to Portugal and I continue to believe that Plan II is a model worth replicating.

You know what else doesn't really matter? Your grades. I had a perfect GPA in all coursework across every subject and department they sent Plan II students to attend - and the only time that achievement impacts my life is when I wake up in a cold sweat thinking I bombed a test and lost my precious `4.0`, something that amuses my wife endlessly. Your grades only matter if they can become something your spouse enjoys teasing you about.
