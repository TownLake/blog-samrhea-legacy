Hi there. My name is Sam. I’m probably busy right now using a spreadsheet for a hobby project that doesn’t need one. Or [walking a dog](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/a-serra-and-new-friends) we named after the second-worst highway in Austin, Mopac.

## Blog

I like to learn how to do things, write down what I learned, and share those notes [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough/). However, I spend more time lately writing goofy stories about growing up in in [Texas](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/texas) or living in [Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/portugal).

## Austin -> Lisbon

I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown in 2019 to help open Cloudflare's office in [Lisbon, Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/one-year-lisbon). What was supposed to be a one year assignment has evolved into an open-ended tenure for me and my family. We like it here and I think you would too - [we're hiring!](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?location=Lisbon%2C+Portugal)

## Work

I [work](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/at-cloudflare) on the Emerging Technology and Incubation team at Cloudflare. We spend every day building capabilities on Cloudflare's network that we think our customers will need one to five years from now - and beyond.

I previously spent six years launching, building, and leading the [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) business at Cloudflare as the VP of Product. I was responsible for the enterprise security use cases of [Cloudflare One](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-one-year-later/) and the proprietary private networking components.

Before Cloudflare I spent half a decade as a Product Manager in the Austin office of ESW Capital. I helped acquire and improve software companies of all sizes through our DevFactory arm. Prior to my time with the ESW Capital group I worked for a medical technology investment firm doing a little bit of everything as we built, bought, and invested in healthcare businesses.

## School

I studied in the Plan II Program at The University of Texas at Austin. That doesn't matter at all, though, to what you should think of me - where we went to school impacts our first job (maybe). Instead, I am adding that here because you should know how cool it is. I believe that major could and should be a model for higher education.

I had a perfect GPA in all coursework, something my wife mocks me for relentlessly because I will wake up in the middle of the night thinking I bombed a test and lost my record. Your grades only matter if they can be something your spouse enjoys teasing you about.
