Hey y'all. My name is Sam. I’m probably busy right now using a spreadsheet for a hobby project that doesn’t need one. Or [walking a dog](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/a-serra-and-new-friends) we named after the second-worst highway in Austin, Mopac.

TI like to learn how to do things, write down what I learned, and share those notes [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough/). However, I spend more time lately writing goofy stories about growing up in in [Texas](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/texas) or living in [Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/portugal).

I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown in 2019 to help open Cloudflare's office in [Lisbon, Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/one-year-lisbon). What was supposed to be a one year assignment has evolved into an open ended tenure for me and my family. We like it here and I think you would too - [we're hiring!](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?location=Lisbon%2C+Portugal)

I'm the [VP of Product](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/at-cloudflare) at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for our [Zero Trust group](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/). The Cloudflare Zero Trust suite helps teams of any size stay safe without slowing them down. I had the opportunity to be the Product Manager for most of the products in that group [back in the day](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/at-cloudflare#-previously). Now I spend all of my time working with brilliant Product Managers and Directors of Product in my team as we obsess over how to use Cloudflare's network to solve the common challenges that [plague all organizations](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-zero-trust-for-galileo-and-athenian/).
