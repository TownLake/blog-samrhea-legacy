Hi there. My name is Sam. I’m probably busy right now using a spreadsheet for a hobby project that doesn’t need one. Or [walking a dog](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/a-serra-and-new-friends) we named after the second-worst highway in Austin, Mopac.

## Blog

I like to learn how to do things, write down what I learned, and share those notes [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough/). However, I spend more time lately writing goofy stories about growing up in in [Texas](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/texas) or living in [Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/portugal).

## Austin -> Lisbon

I'm an Austinite, but I left my hometown in 2019 to help open Cloudflare's office in [Lisbon, Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/one-year-lisbon). What was supposed to be a one year assignment has evolved into an open-ended tenure for me and my family. We like it here and I think you would too - [we're hiring!](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/jobs/?location=Lisbon%2C+Portugal)

## Work

I [work](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/at-cloudflare) on the Emerging Technology and Incubation team at Cloudflare. We spend every day building the capabilities on Cloudflare's network that we think customers will need next.

I previously spent six years launching, building, and leading the [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/) business at Cloudflare as the VP of Product. I was responsible for the enterprise security use cases of [Cloudflare One](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one-one-year-later/) and the proprietary private networking components.

Before Cloudflare I spent several years as a Product Manager in the Austin office of ESW Capital. I helped acquire and improve software companies of all sizes through our DevFactory arm. Prior to my time with the ESW Capital group I worked for a medical technology investment firm doing a little bit of everything as we built, bought, and invested in healthcare technology businesses.

## School

I studied in the [Plan II Program](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/plan2/) at The University of Texas at Austin. Yes, it is a major in and of itself.

My diploma doesn't matter at all, though. Where we went to school _maybe_ impacts our first job. I bring it up here because I loved Plan II and think you would, too. The admittedly weird curriculum seems well-equipped to prepare students for whatever oddball form the future will take. I was able to serve on the Board of Visitors before I moved to Portugal and I continue to believe that Plan II is a model worth replicating.

You know what else doesn't really matter? Your grades. I had a perfect GPA in all coursework across every subject and department they sent Plan II students to attend - and the only time that achievement impacts my life is when I wake up in a cold sweat thinking I bombed a test and lost my precious `4.0`, something that amuses my wife endlessly. Your grades only matter if they can become something your spouse enjoys teasing you about.
