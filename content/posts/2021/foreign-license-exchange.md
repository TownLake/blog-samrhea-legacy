The automobile is the default mode of transportation in Texas. Public transport is sadly lacking (and will probably continue to be for the next few years or decades).

I owned a car in Texas. I drove it everywhere. I didn't love it. Environmental concerns aside, driving is stressful. I hate finding parking. I dislike vehicle maintenance. I'm wary of accidents. I'd rather do something else.

I moved to Lisbon in 2019 where public transport and affordable rideshare let me live a carfree life for nearly two years. Two events broke that model:

1. My wife, Rachel, began working at A-to-Be, part of the larger Brisa transportation company. We purchased a used car to shave hours off of her commute each week.
2. We moved to Sintra (well, we moved about 15 minutes east of Sintra to a tiny village). I live further from a city center than I ever have in my life. I love it. The car we share helps make that easier, but Rachel became increasingly annoyed with being the only chaufeur/driver in the family.

Under increasing pressure, I finally committed to getting my license. However, obtaining a driver's license in Portugal was a bit harder than I expected. Rachel speaks Portuguese pretty well so she navigated this process first. I finally did it a few months ago and wrote down the steps I took.

> **Proceed with caution.** I'm not a lawyer and I speak terrible Portuguese, despite the one hour I spend with a tutor each week. This worked for me. It might work for you. I've talked to people who started this process months before me and are still waiting.

> **Watch the clock.** In theory, if you wait too long to exchange a foreign driving license in Europe you will have to start over and apply for a new license directly from Portugal. I've heard that this is six months after you obtain residency, and [other guides seem to confirm that](https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/portugal/transport/driving-licences/non-eu-licence-exchange), but COVID appears to have extended that deadline. I was able to exhange mine about 16 months after becoming a resident.

**🎯 I have a few goals for this project**

* Be able to drive in Portugal, legally.
* Avoid taking a driving course and test in Portugal, because I cannot drive a manual (I know, I know) and I would struggle with the Portuguese language aspect of the exam.

**🗺️ This walkthrough covers how to:**

* Apostille a driving license in Texas.
* Schedule an appointment to trade the license in Portugal.
* Follow up.

I'm writing this guide using a day counter to give you a sense for timeline. I'll also be collapsing the text I sent in emails so that the guide itself is shorter. You can expand each section to copy-and-paste. I'm also redacting personal information.

## Get your homework ready

You will need a driving license from your home country or state. You will also need to have your driving record `apostilled`. I have wanted to write a longer post about the process to apostille documents for a long time, but in short: not every government in the world knows about every other government's paperwork. The Portuguese government does not know what a driving record from Travis County in Texas should look like. Instead, they agree to an international process which validates that the particular document is authentic.

In my case, I requested my driving record from Travis County in Texas, where I lived. I received it online and printed it. I then took my driving record to the Texas Secretary of State. You can walk into their office in Austin, present a document produced by a local municipality or the State itself, and they will apostille the document - certifying that it is the real deal.

You will also need a fiscal number (a Portuguese tax identification number) and your residency permit ID number.

## Schedule an appointment

### Day 0
From what I have heard, COVID moved much of this process online, which should make it much easier. I started by sending a request to schedule with the IMT, Portugal's governing body for mobility and transport. I included a completed form, the `Pedido de Maracao Para Atendimento Presencial`, which can [be found](https://www.imt-ip.pt/sites/IMTT/Portugues/Documents/ANO%202020/Docs-Covid-19/Formulario_AGENDAMENTOS.pdf) on the IMT website.

I received confirmation the same day with a request for a fee payment of 30 EUR. I paid the fee online the same day.

### Day 6

I received a notice from `gestao.imt@imt-ip.pt` that my process was now registered. Seemed to just be a general confirmation.

### Day 8

I received a PDF guide from `trocas.estrangeiras@impt-ip.pt` that consisted of a new form to complete with similar information to the original submission. The instructions asked me to print and mail the completed form back to IMT (bureacracy here [loves physical paperwork](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2021/zero-trust-samba)).

I also included:

* My driving record from Texas (apostilled)
* A photocopy of my residency permit
* My original driver's license - yes, the actual card

And mailed these materials to

```
CTT, para IMT-Delegação Distrital de  Santarém
Praceta Alves Redol, 7, 2000-182 SANTAREM
```

## Follow up

I heard nothing for several weeks. I did receive an email on Day 35 that I needed to send my original license to them within 10 days, which I had done already on Day 8.

I began to worry a little bit. I mailed the materials with the local postal service here, CTT, using certified mail. I never received the confirmation back that the mail arrived.

I began to send one follow-up email each week, but I would send it on a different day of the week. First week would be a Monday, second week a Tuesday, etc. The goal was to catch someone different who would take pity on me and help me schedule an appointment. I'm not sure if it helped, but eventually I did hear back.

### Day 72

After one of my follow up emails, I received a response from an individual at IMT asking for my fiscal number (which I had included in my original email and in all of my documentation). I sent the information back within the hour and they responded with instructions to go to an underground shopping mall in two days.

## The appointment

Portugal has these really efficient physical centers, *Loja do Cidadão* which translates to *Citizen Shop*. They put all kinds of social services under one roof there like the IMT outpost, utility services, and tax offices. You can find them scattered around in convenient locations like shopping malls.

I arrived 10 minutes prior to my appointment. You stand outside in a big huddle and individual representatives walk outside and call your name. Be early - if you don't jump when your name is called they move on.

Once my name was called, I followed the representative back and they asked a couple questions and took my photo. Whole process took about 10 minutes.

### Day 93

I received my license in the mail!

## What's next?

If you are starting this process, good luck. Hopefully something in here helps. Feel free to [ping me](https://twitter.com/lakeaustinblvd) if you have questions or if you completed this and want to submit an improvement.
