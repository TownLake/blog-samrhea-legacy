The automobile is the default mode of transportation in Texas. Public transport is sadly lacking (and will probably continue to be for the next few years or decades).

I owned a car in Texas. I used it to go everywhere. I didn't love it. Environmental concerns aside, driving is stressful. I hate finding parking. I dislike vehicle maintenance. I'm wary of accidents. I'd rather do something else.

I moved to Lisbon about 2.5 years ago where public transport and affordable rideshare let me live a carfree life for over a year.

🎯 I have a few goals for this project
