Last fall, I migrated my WordPress blog to Cloudflare Workers. I wrote a series of posts documenting the process start-to-finish. These walk throughs cover everything from the lift-and-shift of a WP blog to a serverless platform to automated deployments with GitHub.

Are you social distancing? Good! Me too. If you have some free time indoors now, this is a fun project that totals about 6 hours of work. Keeping a blog can also be a fun way to stay engaged with your community, to share stories and read others.

By the end of this course, you'll have a lightning-fast blog, that runs you (at most) $5 per month, and you'll learn more about serverless computing and automating deployments with GitHub.

## Part Three: Adding video content

### 📽️🔑 ad-free private screening with Cloudflare Access and Stream

This post focuses mostly on publishing a site with password-protected content, but you can skip the Access piece and just use Cloudflare Stream to add ad-free videos to your blog.
