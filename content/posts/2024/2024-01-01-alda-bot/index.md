I moved to Portugal site unseen in August of 2019. I spent the first six months of my time here just trying to immigrate. My family and I figured out which grocery store I prefer, where we wanted to rent an apartment, where to board our dogs. I moved here to help open Cloudflare's Lisbon office and so I was, of course, working. My wife was due to start graduate school at the start of 2020 and so she spent her time doing something smart - she learned Portuguese.

I promised I would commit to learning the language, beyond ordering coffee, once things calmed down. When things did calm down, the pandemic started. The Internet was very popular at that time and my work became even busier. I spent all of 2020 in our attic loft working from when I woke up to when I fell asleep. My Portuguese stalled.

By 2021 things began to feel normal again and I realized that I was about to reemerge into society and cross the two year mark without any real grasp of the language. This shamed me enough that [I even lied about it](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2023/portugal-true). I committed to investing, finally, in proper education. Through a reference I found the most wonderful tutor on the planet, Alda, and began sitting down once a week for hourlong in-person 1-1 lessons.

Supplemented by self-study on the other days of the week (or [most of them](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/habits)) I made progress. Turns out practice works. At this point, though, I've exhausted all of the Pimsleur coursework in European Portuguese and the rest of the advanced materials available online are in Brazilian Portuguese. I need to find a way to keep improving during the week so that I make Alda proud when I sit down for our conversation practice. So I turned to something that people complain will make language learning obsolete - AI.

## What problem do I want to solve?

I want to speak Portuguese with someone who will correct me and elaborate on topics in English when I ask them to pause. My wife is tired of teaching me and I cannot book every slot in my tutor's calendar right now. I want to practice on-demand and in a method that primarily focuses on speaking.

## Building the Bot

OpenAI launched a feature last year that gives users the ability to create their own custom implementation of ChatGPT. When I first read about it, I assumed this was just a way to "save" the kinds of default prompts for different use cases. For example, I relied on ChatGPT for [some](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2023/doctor-gpt) Portuguese translation. Each time I used it, though, I would have to open with:

`The content I am sharing is in European Portuguese (or English). I need you to translate it to English (or European Portuguese, not Brazilian Portuguese).`

That becomes tedious. While ChatGPT is a significantly better translation tool than Google Translate, typing that preface at the start of every interaction was not useful when time mattered. I figured the "Create a ChatGPT" would allow me to save chat threads with a standard prompt.

I was wrong, but directional.

The feature does give you the ability to save a kind of prompt configuration, but the creation flow gives you the ability to customize it in ways that I would not have considered.
