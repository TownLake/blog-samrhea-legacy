I moved to Portugal site unseen in August of 2019. I spent the first six months of my time here just trying to immigrate. My family and I figured out which grocery store I prefer, where we wanted to rent an apartment, where to board our dogs. I moved here to help open Cloudflare's Lisbon office and so I was, of course, working. My wife was due to start graduate school at the start of 2020 and so she spent her time doing something smart - she learned Portuguese.

I promised I would commit to learning the language, beyond ordering coffee, once things calmed down. When things did calm down, the pandemic started. The Internet was very popular at that time and my work became even busier. I spent all of 2020 in our attic loft working from when I woke up to when I fell asleep. My Portuguese stalled.

By 2021 things began to feel normal again and I realized that I was about to reemerge into society and cross the two year mark without any real grasp of the language. This shamed me enough that [I even lied about it](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2023/portugal-true). I committed to investing, finally, in proper education. Through a reference I found the most wonderful tutor on the planet, Alda, and began sitting down once a week for hourlong in-person 1-1 lessons.

Supplemented by self-study on the other days of the week (or [most of them](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/habits)) I made progress. Turns out practice works.
