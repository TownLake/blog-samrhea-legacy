> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I loved _The Expanse_ television series but still have not picked up the books. I saw an article in a website I visit more or less daily, [The Ringer](https://theringer.com), about a new book from the same two authors who write under the James S.A. Corey pseudonym. The first of a new planned series, this book trades the gritty, Solar System realism for new galaxies and a Noah's Ark worth of alien species. After dipping my toe into science fiction more recently with [Project Hail Mary](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2024/hail-mary), I decided to take a break from my Tom Clancy marathon to pick this up.

### Publisher Summary

The United States has stared down many threats with President Jack Ryan at the helm, but what if heâ€™s not there when we need him? Thatâ€™s the question facing a nation in the most shocking entry in Tom Clancy's #1 New York Times bestselling series.

A shadowy billionaire uses his fortune to further his corrupt ambitions. Along the way, heâ€™s toppled democratically elected governments and exacerbated divisions within stable nations. The competitors heâ€™s destroyed, the people heâ€™s hurt, theyâ€™re all just marks on a ledger. Now, heâ€™s ready to implement his most ambitious plan of all. Thereâ€™s only one force standing in his wayâ€”President Jack Ryan.

How do you compel a man like Jack Ryan to bend? Heâ€™s personally faced down everything from the Russian navy to cartel killers. It will take more than political headwinds or media disfavor to cause him to turn from his duty to the American people, but every man has an Achilles heel. Jack Ryanâ€™s is his family.

The answer is as simple as it is shocking. The billionaire has assembled an international team of the most ruthless mercenaries alive. Their missionâ€”kidnap the First Lady.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* Alright, here's the deal - I liked it. I'm absolutely going to read the next books in the series. I am bought in and intrigued. That said, whew, this thing was bleak. You have some promise of hope in the forshadowing but this novel was dark, tragic, and not exactly hopeful.
* Still, fun premise.
* We spent way, way too much time talking about laboratories and academic funding. Just way too much.
* Also, like _The Ringer_ [pointed out](https://www.theringer.com/2024/8/12/24218143/the-mercy-of-gods-review-the-captives-war-james-s-a-corey-sci-fi), this thing has much larger scope (galaxies, lightspeed travel, more sentient aliens) than The Expanse series but the aperture is much more tightly centered around this abducted crew than the planet-spanning Expanse novels.
