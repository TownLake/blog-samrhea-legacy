After enough Super Bocks about half of my Portuguese friends will claim descent from an aristocratic title holder. The evidence is flimsy but I adore these stories. An aunt discovered a box of letters in a country house that has been in the family for generations. A grandmother's middle name cross referenced with baptismal records in a village. Tales of squandered fortunes and scheming uncles and lurid affairs.

America lacks this kind of aristocratic history. We lean on professional titles and new money. The system feels more meritocratic but makes for mediocre dinner party conversation.

_Unless we're talking about outlaw stories. Americans love to tell tales about distant relations who were Wild West criminals. I swear to God, every woman I have ever dated seriously, including my wife, has claimed to have a prominent horse thief in their family. It is one of a few things that make me believe that this life might, in fact, be a simulation. Or just that all my girlfriends had serious Texas roots._

Before LinkedIn became a cess pit of posts about how you can apply lessons from your divorce to B2B SaaS, the primary purpose of the social network was to prominently feature your own title regalia.
