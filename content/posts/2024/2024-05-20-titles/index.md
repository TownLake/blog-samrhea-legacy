After enough Super Bocks some of my Portuguese friends will claim descent from an aristocratic title holder. The evidence is flimsy but I love these stories. An aunt discovered a box of letters in a country house that has been in the family for generations. A grandmother's middle name cross referenced with baptismal records in a village. Tales of squandered fortunes and scheming uncles and lurid affairs.

America lacks generational heraldry, but we are still humans and still status-obsessed. So we just lean on professional titles and new money. The system feels slightly more meritocratic but makes for mediocre dinner party conversation.

_Unless we're talking about outlaw stories. Americans love to tell tales about distant relations who were Wild West criminals. I swear to God, every woman I have ever dated seriously, including my wife, has claimed to have a prominent horse thief in their family. It is one of a few things that make me believe that this might be a simulation. Or maybe just that I have a thing for women with serious Texas roots._

Before LinkedIn became a cess pit of posts about how you can apply lessons from your divorce to B2B SaaS, the primary purpose of the social network was to feature your own title regalia. The first step when you signed up was to create a chronology of your ascent through schools and companies and roles.

My entries looked odd. I spent years making all the wrong decisions if you cared about titles. I just found people I liked who were doing hard things. And I am eternally grateful for it.

When I graduated from The University of Texas, I turned down a full-time offer to join Bain in order to work for this eccentric investor because I thought it sounded more fun. I bailed on the most `prestige job title` someone at that stage could have in that era. It worked out.

A few years later I joined the M&A engine at ESW Capital - a firm no one had heard about (that [changed slightly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2021/04/27/inside-a-remote-work-billionaires-new-plan-to-turn-his-white-collar-workers-into-algorithms/)). Again, something that I just thought would be exciting rather than brag-worthy. I learned so much and had a blast.

That healthy habit followed me when I joined this privately-held software company that did something on the Internet called `Cloudflare`. No one in my life in Texas could tell you what Cloudflare did much less spell the name of the firm correctly. That was fine by me. Like the other hops, I followed the people and ideas that I wanted to spend time being around. Again, another home run decision.

Sometime during the pandemic, after our IPO, I began to care about that old LinkedIn page. It snuck up on me. I had been lucky to find some success at Cloudflare but when I joined the organization we were rightfully stingy about titles. Everyone was just a `Product Manager` with a couple `Directors` scattered about. We were too busy building and too small to worry about levels like senior/junior prefixes.

And then one day we hired a `Director` with no direct reports and the little voice of envy in my head was handed a megaphone. This individual was someone held pretty senior roles in other, more traditional, software companies and the starting title was part of their negotiation. That is all well and fine but in 2020 I wanted to riot.

I had everything my ego ever wanted at this stage. I was `VP of Product` in our most exciting product portfolio to graduate from our experimental research group. A business I had led since I was just a Product Manager and the "portfolio" was just a prototype. Didn't matter. No one at a dinner party or 4-hour lunch in Portugal cared.


This used to matter to me, a lot.

The arms race changed me. 

like that moment when people start taking kickers or tight ends
