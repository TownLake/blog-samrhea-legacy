After enough Super Bocks some of my Portuguese friends will claim descent from aristocratic title holders. The evidence is flimsy but I love these stories. An aunt discovered a box of letters in a country house that has been in the family for generations. A grandmother's middle name cross referenced with baptismal records in a village. Tales of squandered fortunes and scheming uncles and lurid affairs.

America lacks this kind of generational heraldry, but we are still humans and we are still status-obsessed. So we just lean on professional titles and new money. The system feels slightly more meritocratic but makes for mediocre dinner party conversation.

_Unless we're talking about outlaw stories. Americans love to tell tales about distant relations who were Wild West criminals. I swear to God, every woman I have ever dated seriously, including my wife, has claimed to have a prominent horse thief in their family. It is one of a few things that make me believe that this might be a simulation. Or maybe just that I have a thing for women with serious Texas roots._

Before LinkedIn became a cess pit of posts about how you can apply lessons from your divorce to B2B SaaS, the primary purpose of the social network was to feature your own title regalia. The first step when you signed up was to create a chronology of your climb through schools and companies and roles.

My entries looked odd. I spent years making all the wrong decisions if you cared about titles. I just found people I liked who were doing hard things. And I am eternally grateful for it.

When I graduated from The University of Texas, I turned down a full-time offer to join Bain in order to work for this eccentric investor because I thought it sounded more fun. I bailed on the most `prestige job` someone at that stage could have in that era. It worked out.

A few years later I joined the M&A engine at ESW Capital - a firm no one had heard about (that [changed slightly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2021/04/27/inside-a-remote-work-billionaires-new-plan-to-turn-his-white-collar-workers-into-algorithms/)). Again, something that I just thought would be exciting. I didn't think much about the brand recognition. I went to learn and I had a blast.

That healthy habit followed me in 2018 when I joined this privately-held software company called `Cloudflare` that did something on the Internet. I was ready for a new challenge after ESW and the professional mentor that I trusted the most said I should do whatever it took to work with a particular leader at Cloudflare. I took his advice.

No one in my Texan life could describe what Cloudflare did much less spell the name of the firm. That was fine by me. Like the other hops, I followed the people and ideas that I wanted to spend time being around. This decision also worked out - big time.

I kept rowing the boat without thinking about titles until a little voice in the back of my head found an audience. Sometime during the pandemic, I felt both a bit more accomplished and a lot more bored. Like other white collar pandemic professionals, work had become my primary identity and social outlet. I started to care about that old LinkedIn page.

It snuck up on me. I had been lucky to find some success at Cloudflare but when I joined the organization we were (rightfully) stingy about titles. Everyone was just a `Product Manager` with a couple `Director`s scattered about. We were too busy building and too small to worry about levels like senior/junior prefixes.

And then someone drafted a Running Back. If you have played fantasy football, you'll be familiar with that moment in a league draft when the first person takes a Running Back or Tight End and a scramble begins. Suddenly you are worried that you might get left behind. Do they know something that you don't and are you going to be left without a chair when the music stops?

A few things happened that made me (embarrassingly) green with envy. We became a more mature company and attracted more senior talent. They joined with correspondingly senior titles. The team we already had inside of the organization had also earned the right to ask for promotions after years of grinding it out. All of those are normal things in the natural lifecycle of a software company, but my knee-jerk reaction was to worry that this was an arms race and I was going to lose.



I had everything my ego ever wanted at this stage. I was `VP of Product` in our most exciting product portfolio to graduate from our experimental research group. A business I had led since I was just a Product Manager and the "portfolio" was just a prototype. Didn't matter. No one at a dinner party or 4-hour lunch in Portugal cared.


This used to matter to me, a lot.

The arms race changed me.
