After enough Super Bocks some of my Portuguese friends will claim descent from an aristocratic title holder. The evidence is flimsy but I adore these stories. An aunt discovered a box of letters in a country house that has been in the family for generations. A grandmother's middle name cross referenced with baptismal records in a village. Tales of squandered fortunes and scheming uncles and lurid affairs.

America lacks this kind of aristocratic history. We lean on professional titles and new money. The system feels more meritocratic but makes for mediocre dinner party conversation.

_Unless we're talking about outlaw stories. Americans love to tell tales about distant relations who were Wild West criminals. I swear to God, every woman I have ever dated seriously, including my wife, has claimed to have a prominent horse thief in their family. It is one of a few things that make me believe that this might, in fact, be a simulation. Or just that I have a thing for women with serious Texas roots._

Before LinkedIn became a cess pit of posts about how you can apply lessons from your divorce to B2B SaaS, the primary purpose of the social network was to prominently feature your own title regalia. This used to matter to me, a lot.

The arms race changed me. When I graduated from The University of Texas, I turned down a full-time offer to join Bain in order to work for this eccentric investor because I thought it sounded more fun. I bailed on the most `prestige job title` someone at that age could have. It worked out for me. A few years later I joined the M&A engine at ESW Capital. Again, something that I just thought would be exciting rather than brag-worthy.

That healthy habit followed me when I joined some privately-held software company that did something on the Internet called Cloudflare. No one in my life in Texas could tell you what Cloudflare did much less spell the name of the firm correctly. That was fine by me. Like the other hops, I followed the people and ideas that I wanted to spend time being around.

Sometime during the pandemic, after our IPO and the halo that follows, I began to care. It snuck up on me. I had been lucky to find real success at Cloudflare but when I joined the organization we were rightfully stingy about titles. Everyone was just a `Product Manager` with a couple `Directors` scattered about. We were too busy building or to small to worry about levels or senior/junior prefixes.

And then one day we hired a `Director` with no direct reports and the little voice of envy in my head was handed a megaphone. This individual was someone held pretty senior roles in other, more traditional, software companies and the starting title was part of their negotiation. That is all well and fine but in 2020 I wanted to riot.

I had everything my ego ever wanted at this stage. I was `VP of Product` in our most exciting product portfolio to graduate from our experimental research group. A business I had led since I was just a Product Manager and the "portfolio" was just a prototype. Didn't matter. No one at a dinner party or 4-hour lunch in Portugal cared.
