## Quick Context

I am [consistent](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/calcheck-and-meeting-note-accountability) and [organized](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/euro-office-time) to a fault. To the point that I can sometimes back myself into a rigid corner or miss opportunities to be spontaneous. Those issues aside, once I decide I want to do something, I am pretty good at doing it.

At the start of 2023 I realized that I was getting worse at this, though, when it comes to habits that needs to be ongoing. Projects are easy. Creating consistent routines? Less so.

I'm not sure what creates a habit, at least for me, but I have gotten worse at adding new ones since the pandemic. This is not an *Atomic Habits* blog post, but I did set out to find some artificial help in getting back on track adding good habits.

I landed on the **Streaks** [app](https://streaksapp.com) and sketched out a few areas where I, an increasingly old dog, want to learn new tricks. I've started writing down the results in [this series](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/habits/) for posterity and accountability.

I measure this each quarter in a series that I publish on this blog; you can find previous editions [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/habits/).

## AM Habits

The goal is to do these before 7AM. This is especially true now that I am a parent. For some tasks that require deeper focus this is my only time when I can focus at all.

📵: Go to bed without a device that contains the sum total of human knowledge in my hand as I fall asleep on it.

💪: Knock out 100 push ups each day.

🛏️: Do not get back in bed.

✍️: Write for 20 minutes each day excluding writing I do for work.

🇵🇹: Spend 30 minutes each day practicing Portuguese.

☀️: Apply sunscreen to my face and neck each day.

| Month | 📵 | 💪 | 🛏️ | ✍️ | 🇵🇹 | ☀️ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jan | 🥇 | 🥇 | ⬜ | 🟥 | 🟥 | 🥇 |
| Feb | 🥇 | 🥇 | 🥇 | 🟧 | 🟥 | 🥇 |
| Mar | X | X | X | X | X | X |

### Health Habits

Goals that contribute to general health and well being.

🕗: Close the kitchen at 8pm. I am an early eater - left to my own devices I eat dinner at about 6 PM. When I eat after 8 PM I am not hungry - I am scrounging because I am bored. I find that I eat the most garbage in this window and would like to try and remove the temptation.

🦷: Floss my teeth.

🫧: Rinse with mouthwash.

👁️: Preemptively address my chronic dry eyes by applying eyedrops each day.

🚰: Drink 2.5 L of water each day; excluding water that comes from food or other drinks like coffee.

| Month | 🕗 | 🦷 | 🫧 | 👁️ | 🚰 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jan | 🟩 | 🥇 | 🥇 | 🥇 | 🥇 |
| Feb | 🟨 | 🥇 | 🥇 | 🥇 | 🥇 |
| Mar | X | X | X | X | X |

### Digital and Learning Habits

Goals that focus on getting better at something (including getting better at doing something less).

🐦: Use Twitter for a maximum of 20 minutes each day.

👾: Use Reddit for a maximum of 20 minutes each day.

🌅: Don't open social media of any kind until after 10 AM.

📴: Try not to use my phone on Saturdays.

| Month | 👾 | 🐦 | 🌅 | 📴 |

## Why do this?

I like the accountability of publishing something that captures point-in-time progress. I also enjoy [sharing](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-productivity) how I think about work.

Like everything in this blog, though, I do this for me. I am both sentimental and filled with existential dread. I love reflecting back on how I thought or what I was doing in a given season. I find joy in writing something that has [somewhat public](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-this-blog) permanence. If anything, I'm [feeding the models](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/five-minute-ai-site).

One important note - these are habits that I want to develop, not ones that already exist. I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth and never skip a work out etc. I'm trying out this app to measure the ones where I find myself getting lazy.
