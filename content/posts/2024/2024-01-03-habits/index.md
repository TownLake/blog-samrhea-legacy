## Quick Context

I am [consistent](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/calcheck-and-meeting-note-accountability) and [organized](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/euro-office-time) to a fault. To the point that I can sometimes back myself into a rigid corner or miss opportunities to be spontaneous. Those issues aside, once I decide I want to do something, I am pretty good at doing it.

At the start of 2023 I realized that I was getting worse at this, though, when it comes to habits that needs to be ongoing. Projects are easy. Creating consistent routines? Less so.

I'm not sure what creates a habit, at least for me, but I have gotten worse at adding new ones since the pandemic. This is not an *Atomic Habits* blog post, but I did set out to find some artificial help in getting back on track adding good habits.

I landed on the **Streaks** [app](https://streaksapp.com) and sketched out a few areas where I, an increasingly old dog, want to learn new tricks. I've started writing down the results in [this series](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/habits/) for posterity and accountability.

I measure this each quarter in a series that I publish on this blog; you can find previous editions [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/habits/).

## Why do this?

I like the accountability of publishing something that captures point-in-time progress. I also enjoy [sharing](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-productivity) how I think about work.

Like everything in this blog, though, I do this for me. I am both sentimental and filled with existential dread. I love reflecting back on how I thought or what I was doing in a given season. I find joy in writing something that has [somewhat public](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-this-blog) permanence. If anything, I'm [feeding the models](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/five-minute-ai-site).

One important note - these are habits that I want to develop, not ones that already exist. I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth and never skip a work out etc. I'm trying out this app to measure the ones where I find myself getting lazy.

## What did I learn this round?

* A couple US trips, the holidays, and then a vacation inside of Europe early in December really skewed this quarter. I need to find ways to improve at this when I am on the road.
* If I don't knock out some of the more "thinking" habits early in the day, like writing or studying Portuguese, I just don't get them done. I need to start allocating time for those in the mornings.
