![iCloud Vault](./media/icloud-vault.webp)

Late last night (my time) users around the world [began](https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/signed-out-of-apple-id-account-problem-password/) [reporting](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/27/apple-id-accounts-logging-out-users/) that they were suddenly locked out of their Apple iCloud accounts.

I imagine Apple will respond today or tomorrow that a systemwide change in account security prompted some bucket of users to reauthenticate. The users will regain access. Rumors about upcoming AI features in iOS 18 will again take center stage.

This would be annoying on a temporary basis. How destructive would it be on a permanent basis?
