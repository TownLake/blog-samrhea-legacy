> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
At my wife's suggestion, I read the Emily Henry novel *Book Lovers* [last month](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2023/book-lovers). I loved it. I sincerely enjoy rom com films and, like [my recent audiobook tour](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2023/thrawn) back through *Thrawn*, I forgot how much I enjoy reading fiction after spending the last few years consuming exclusively business books or historical non-fiction because I thought that was what I was supposed to be doing at this stage in my life. Glad I was wrong.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* This was a lot darker than *Book Lovers* - *Book Lovers* felt like a sophisticated take on a Hallmark movie that avoided some of the saccharine trappings, played with the cliches, and still kept the heart and positivity. The cults, affairs, and gloominess felt jarring. I have now read two Emily Henry novels, so I can't say which feels more normal. I enjoyed *Book Lovers* more.
* Also a slower burn than *Book Lovers*! The obvious couple characters do not really kick off the relationship until the third act.
* Having grown up in Texas, I tend to forget that the Great Lakes coastline is home to some genuienly nice beaches or so Midwesterners have tried to convince me.
