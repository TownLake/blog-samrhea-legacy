> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I adored the Star Wars Extended Universe (EU) growing up. I loved how much depth a book could explore about the universe that a two-hour film focused on a couple protagonists could not. Thrawn became one of my favorite characters after Timothy Zahn's *Heir to the Empire*. The Vulcan of Star Wars. The scary idea of "what if the Empire was way more competent and efficient?" I loved how he teed up the Yuuzhan Vong.

When Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the EU became part of the "Legends" catalog and no longer was canon - Disney had a blank slate to build around the movies. After pushing the sequel trilogy, they are steering back into the content created by David Filoni (*The Clone Wars* tv show before the acquisition made the prequels seem interesting, gave Anakin a fascinating character arc, and created Ahsoka Tano). If you have not watched *The Clone Wars* yet, give it a try and then go watch Episodes 2 and 3.

Under Filoni's leadership, the media empire released shows that built on his world like *The Bad Batch*, *The Mandalorian*, *The Book of Boba Fett*, and *Star Wars: Rebels*. *Rebels* introduced Thrawn into the screen canon and Disney brought back Timothy Zahn to write an updated, canon-approved, introduction book called *Thrawn*.

I read *Thrawn* in 2018 and enjoyed it. I had not followed through with *Star Wars: Rebels*, though, and started watching the show after finishing the latest season of *The Mandalorian*. When I remembered that the new Thrawn book and the third season of *Rebels* had overlapping plot lines, I downloaded the audiobook to catch back up.

I have also been walking my dogs a lot more lately while we replant our grass and have more audiobook time...

## Notes - No Spoilers
* Star Wars has a real power scaling problem when comparing screen and book versions. In books like *Thrawn*, the Empire fields expert pilots and commandos on the ground to ruthlessly quell dissent. In *Rebels*, the stormtroopers and other Imperial characters become goofy cartoons. I get that *Rebels* is a cartoon, targeted to kids, but I found it jarring. *Andor* and *Rogue One* feature characters with capabilities much closer to their book counterparts.
* I did not love the sequel trilogy. Another project of Filoni's seems to be rehabilitating some of the wilder decisions made in the sequel trilogy, like Palpatine's reappearance, through shows like *The Mandalorian*. Revisiting Thrawn's new, canon, storyline made me wish they had instead adapted the Yuuzhan Vong storyline into the sequel trilogy.
* I forgot how much fun it is to listen to a fiction audiobook narrated by a real professional. Most of the audiobooks that I have consumed lately are nerdier, academic non-fiction history tomes. This was a blast and I enjoyed every minute.
