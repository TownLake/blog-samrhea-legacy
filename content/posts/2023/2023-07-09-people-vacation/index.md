> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/reading) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
At my wife's urging, I have read two physical Emily Henry books in the last few months and adored both - she was right. We decided to take our relationship to the next level and listen to a new one together on the car trips we take around Portugal.

We mostly did this because we have wildly different taste in Podcasts. I listen to mostly nerd culture things from The Ringer or `Tech-Bro-Pontification` genres. Rachel is civilized and preferes news and current events podcasts.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* This felt like a return to something more fun. My first Emily Henry novel was *Book Lovers*, which I enjoyed, and I followed that with *Beach Read* which felt unnecessarily darker. I had more fun listening to this.
