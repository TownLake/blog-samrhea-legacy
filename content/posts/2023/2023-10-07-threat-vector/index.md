> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I picked up a Tom Clancy book in the Stockholm Central train station a couple months ago and it made me remember how fun these can be. So I rewound in the series by about a decade and picked up at Book 10 in the run. I have been spending a lot of time wading through some complex, but interesting, challenges at the office - all good problems, but the kinds of things that leave me beat at the end of the day and ready to jump into a novel about spies and special forces for 30 minutes before I fall asleep.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* Adam Yao! One of my favorite Jack-Ryan-verse characters makes his initial appearance.
* I work in cybersecurity and this book focuses on it. It sure makes our industry look sexier than it is.
* An early call out to Zero Trust networking! Early in the book Gavin's network security is designed as one that requires "employees to 'earn' access to his network." Now, in this book, they do that by rotating their password and attending security training - two things that almost definitely do not work - but it is a start!
* This has to be the absolute best genre for LLM AI creation, right? There are so many of these books to train against, the point is not the literature, you could inject current events...
