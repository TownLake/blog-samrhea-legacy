You aren't supposed to do this. My wife does not want me to do this and insists that I still visit my doctor. My wife's father is a physician and has opinions about this (see below). ChatGPT repeatedly warned me not to do this. This blog walks through how I did it.

## A quick primer on my health

I'm lucky - I'm pretty healthy. I am 33, I don't smoke, and I am able to maintain a healthy weight. I eat a relatively strict and balanced diet, I walk my dogs and my self all over Portugal most days. I work out six days a week. A few Sundays ago I rolled out of bed and ran the Lisbon Half Marathon in less than two hours after preparing for just a couple weeks.

The foundation of this is dumb luck and privilege. I was born without any serious health complications. I grew up in an environment where clean air, food, and water were abundant. I was rarely in physical danger. I can combine those advantages with a commitment to diet and exercise. For now, I am fortunate.

_Of course this is part of what terrifies me about being alive. Someone can have that healthcare history and a blood clot could find them one morning. Or a neurological disease. Or they just fall backwards funny. Being a human is terrifying in its unpredictability. That's a discussion for another time._

I haven't escaped entirely unscathed - a spontaneous pneumothorax when I was 19 has left me with some lingering respiratory issues that pop up from time to time. My knees are also banged up but I don't think most boys who grew up playing sports in Texas could say otherwise.

All that to say, a stupid experiment like this is relatively without consequence. My annual physical last year revealed that every single value that could be tested sits within the normal range. The first pass at this report suggests very little changed. Time to use that window to get weird.

## First, medicine in Portuguese

I have found the Portuguese healthcare system to be phenomenal. I am fortunate enough to have private insurance through my employer, but the experience in the private system exceeds what I found in the United States and the cost is outrageously lower. I also have not had any serious healthcare scares in my four years in Portugal. A few annual check ups, a broken hand, and some dry eyes represent the bulk of my visits. I have never needed to see the kind of specialist where the best in the world could only be found in a place like Houston.
