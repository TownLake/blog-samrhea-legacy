You aren't supposed to do this. My wife does not want me to do this and insists that I still visit my doctor. My wife's father is a physician and has opinions about this (see below). ChatGPT repeatedly warned me not to do this. This blog walks through how I did it.

A few weeks ago I visited my hospital here in Portugal for my annual physical. In my case, that consists of a blood work panel, a chest x-ray, and a cardio stress test. I received my results last week while walking to a meeting in Lisbon. The genuinely great app from the hospital system shared five pages of exam observations and data in medical European Portuguese. I speak conversational Portuguese but most dinner parties do not discuss gamma-glutamyl transferase.

I also only had my phone on me - translating this word-by-word would be tough. So I took five screenshots of the results and shared them with OpenAI's ChatGPT and asked for a translation.

First, this amazes me. I'm not just translating medical terms on my phone - I'm doing so by sharing a screenshot in a format that ChatGPT likely has never sen before. A piece of software is taking these images as inputs, reading them, thinking through what they mean, and printing out a near perfect translation.

Second, I wanted to know a little more while I had more time on this walk. I typically schedule a follow up with my general practitioner to review the results each year. The meeting tends to be boring - I'm fortunate to be relatively healthy. However, I started by asking ChatGPT some questions that I would ask my doctor.

## A quick primer on my health

I'm lucky - I'm pretty healthy. I am in my mid-thirties, I don't smoke, and I am able to maintain a healthy weight. I eat a relatively strict and balanced diet. I walk my dogs and my self all over Portugal most days. I work out six days a week. A few Sundays ago I rolled out of bed and ran the Lisbon Half Marathon in less than two hours after preparing for just a couple weeks.

The foundation of this is a combination of chance and privilege. I was born without any serious health complications. I grew up in an environment where clean air, food, and water were abundant. I was rarely in physical danger. I combine those advantages with a commitment to diet and exercise. For now, I am fortunate.

_Of course this is part of what terrifies me about being alive. Someone can have that healthcare history and a blood clot could find them one morning. Or a neurological disease. Or they just fall backwards funny. Being a human is terrifying in its unpredictability. That's a discussion for another time._

I haven't escaped entirely unscathed - a spontaneous pneumothorax when I was 19 has left me with some lingering respiratory issues that pop up from time to time. My knees are also banged up but I don't think most boys who grew up playing sports in Texas could say otherwise.

All that to say, a stupid experiment like this is relatively without consequence. My annual physical last year revealed that every single value that could be tested sits within the normal range. The first pass at this report suggests very little changed. Time to use that window to get weird.

## First, medicine in Portuguese

I have found the Portuguese healthcare system to be phenomenal. I am fortunate enough to have private insurance through my employer, but the experience in the private system exceeds what I found in the United States and the cost is lower. I also have not had any serious healthcare scares in my four years in Portugal. A few annual check ups, a broken hand, and some dry eyes represent the bulk of my visits. I have never needed to see the kind of specialist where the best in the world could only be found in a place like Houston.

I also have not invested much time in learning medical terms in Portuguese. I know enough to describe or triage an emergency, but the pericardium is not high on my flash card list.

## Start with a summary

So far, no surprises. ChatGPT has confirmed what I suspected when I scanned the reference values - I am healthy and within a normal range.

## What changed?

I am also interested in progress, or at least change. If all the values are normal, did some get more or less normal? My lifestyle in 2023 looks very similar to my lifestyle in 2022, but I have paid more attention to my diet. Most of my healthcare sins consist of traveling way too much. I have crossed the Atlantic about 30 times in 2022 and 2023. When I do so, I blow away [my routines](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2023/habits-q2). I sleep less, I eat poorly, I drink more, I even miss the gym on rare days.
