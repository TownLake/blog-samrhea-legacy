## Quick Context

I am [consistent](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/calcheck-and-meeting-note-accountability) and [organized](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/euro-office-time) - not always good things. I can sometimes back myself into a rigid corner or miss opportunities to be spontaneous. Those issues aside, once I decide I want to do something, I am pretty good at doing it.

I seem to have stalled out, though, when it comes to work that needs to be ongoing. Projects are easy. Creating consistent routines? Less so.

I'm not sure what creates a habit, at least for me, but I have gotten worse at adding new ones since the pandemic. This is not an *Atomic Habits* blog post, but I did set out this year to find some artificial help in getting back on track adding good habits.

I found the **Streaks** [app](https://streaksapp.com), which I like a lot so far, and sketched out a few areas where I, an increasingly old dog, want to learn new tricks. I've started writing down the results in [this series](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/habits/) for posterity.

I measure this each quarter in a series that I publish on this blog; you can find previous editions [here](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/habits/).

## Current Scoreboard

I'm breaking up the scoreboard this quarter for a few reasons:
* Streaks encourages you to split up your habits into buckets that max out at six. As a result, I've grouped mine based on time-of-day and type.
* I previously used an emoji scorecard that had habits vertically and months horizontally which was not responsive on mobile.
* Six-across might also fail here, but we'll see if it is better.

### AM Habits

The goal is to do these before 7AM.

💪: Knock out 100 push ups each day.

### Health Habits

Goals that contribute to general health and well being.

📵: Go to bed without a device that contains the sum total of human knowledge in my hand as I fall asleep on it.

## Why do this?

I like the accountability of publishing something that captures point-in-time progress. I also enjoy [sharing](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-productivity) how I think about work.

Like everything in this blog, though, I do this for me. I am both sentimental and filled with existential dread. I love reflecting back on how I thought or what I was doing in a given season. I find joy in writing something that has [somewhat public](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-this-blog) permanence. If anything, I'm [feeding the models](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/five-minute-ai-site).

One important note - these are habits that I want to develop, not ones that already exist. I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth and never skip a work out etc. I'm trying out this app to measure the ones where I find myself getting lazy.

## What did I learn this round?

* Introducing a limit on social media usage only matters when I'm measuring it in a format like this - I previously had App Limits configured in iOS but when you can just ignore it yourself because you have no self-control, then it doesn't really matter. Knowing it went on the scoreboard did matter.
* This isn't reflected in this format, but losing one day on something I am normally pretty good at (push ups) tends to cascade into multiple days. I'm not the first to call this out but: never miss more than one day in a row.
* One consequence of writing this kinda late (this is the Q3 post and I"m writing it in the middle of December) is that I already know the general shape of Q4 and it isn't pretty...
