Smoking is [more common](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/smoking-rates-by-country) in Portugal than the United States. If I attend a large dinner with friends in Lisbon I expect that about a third of the table will step outside before coffees arrive to smoke.

Part of me is jealous. When they go smoke, they can use their phones. It would seem terribly rude to say "Excuse me. I am going to step outside to scroll on my phone for five minutes," but I sometimes feel that way. My iPhone has become more like a cigarette than a tool. I bought this device (and a dozen iterations of it) to get things done. Instead I reach for it during any pause in my day to consume.

I pull it out of my pocket when I'm still. I open it without thinking when I'm walking in Lisbon and stop at a red pedestrian light. I even find myself with my phone in my hand, scrolling Twitter, asking "wait, I unlocked my phone to do something - what was that?"

My phone stopped becoming a tool around the same time that social media apps showed up in the app store. I have been carrying around a circus carnival wherever I go for more than a decade. I sincerely want to stop this.

## How do I use my phone today?

I would rather you peak at my browser history than my Screen Time report. That feature is probably the most intimate data point available today. The void we stare into can stare back with receipts.

I found it to be a valuable way of distinguishing whether or not my device is _mostly_ a tool. I use the word `tool` to represent use cases that wind up with me accomplishing something that I needed to do. Paying bills, responding to an email from our immigration lawyers, figuring out the best way to avoid traffic while driving to Sintra.

And my iPhone is definitely a tool in that sense! This device can check off those items on my to do list and more. The problem begins when I leave it open. I don't finish my commute and keep sitting in my car. However, I do routinely check the weather and then find myself on Instagram.

## What makes my phone a tool?



## What makes my phone a circus carnival and why is it hard to quit?

## What am I going to do about it?

Isn't the easy answer to just delete Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter? Yes. Am I strong enough to do that? Probably not.

1. I need a phone.
2. I sometimes "need" to have resources available that are not tools.
