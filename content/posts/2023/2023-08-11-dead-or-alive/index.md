> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I picked up a Tom Clancy book in the Stockholm Central train station a couple months ago and it made me remember how fun these can be. So I rewound in the series by about a decade and picked up at Book 10 in the run. I have been spending a lot of time wading through some complex, but interesting, challenges at the office - all good problems, but the kinds of things that leave me beat at the end of the day and ready to jump into a novel about spies and special forces for 30 minutes before I fall asleep.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* This thing is a real product of the Obama era - and not in the best way. The thinly veiled criticisms of the in-universe President who replaced Jack Ryan Sr, specifically the complaints from the intelligence community, feel forced in an otherwise fun read.
* By extension, the Sam Driscoll plot line feels ham-fisted.
* Also, somewhat prescient (sadly) point in the book where the former Chief of Staff has to remind the elder Ryan that the press is not the enemy...
* Texas gets a shout out! Specifically MD Anderson in Houston as having the best cancer treatment on earth.
* Even though the book was only written 12 years ago, the impact of technology makes it feel outdaded already - which speaks more to the advances in encrypted communication, smart phones, and satellites/drones than the book itself.
* Those complaints aside, and I'm spending more time on gripes than usual today, reading Tom Clancy books continues to be silly fun and wildly entertaining.
* The technical descriptions of encryption were very, very good in a "ELI5" kind of way.
* This was the first book I read on [my new Kindle](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2023/kindle) and the rumors are true - this is a pretty great reading experience. Bonus points that it allows me to leave my phone outside of the bedroom so that I don't wind up scrolling Reddit for 2 hours instead of falling asleep.
