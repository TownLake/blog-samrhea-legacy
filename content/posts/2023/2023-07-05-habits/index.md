I am [consistent](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2020/calcheck-and-meeting-note-accountability) and [organized](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/euro-office-time) - not always good things. I can sometimes back myself into a rigid corner or miss opportunities to be spontaneous. Those issues aside, once I decide I want to keep doing something, I am pretty good at doing it.

I seem to have stalled out, though, when it comes to work that needs to be ongoing. Projects are easy. Creating consistent routines? Less so.

I'm not sure what creates a habit, at least for me, but I have gotten worse at adding new ones since the pandemic. This is not an *Atomic Habits* blog post, but I did set out this year to find some artificial help in getting back on track adding good habits.

I found the **Streaks** [app](https://streaksapp.com), which I like a lot so far, and sketched out a few areas where I, an increasingly old dog, want to learn new tricks. I've started writing down the results in [this series](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/habits/) for posterity.

## Why do this?

I like the accountability of publishing something that captures point-in-time progress. I also enjoy [sharing](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-productivity) how I think about work.

Like everything in this blog, though, I do this for me. I am both sentimental and filled with existential dread. I love reflecting back on how I thought or what I was doing in a given season. I find joy in writing something that has [somewhat public](https://blog.samrhea.com/pages/projects#%EF%B8%8F-this-blog) permanence. If anything, I'm [feeding the models](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2022/five-minute-ai-site).

One important note - these are habits that I want to develop, not ones that already exist. I'm pretty good at brushing my teeth and never skip a work out etc. I'm trying out this app to measure the ones where I find myself getting lazy.

## What did I learn this round?

* Travel is still the habit killer. Like nutrition or sleep, habits are so easy to ignore and break when you are jet lagged or busy in a new environment.
* The habits where I need to create something (writing) or learn something (Portuguese) are the most difficult to keep consistent.
* That maxim is true - if you miss two days in a road, you're toast. That happened to me with push ups after I skipped a day due to procrastination and then forgetting to do it. Once I missed one day, it became way easier to miss another day when I was at something like a 12 day streak.

## New Habits

Nothing added since the last post.

## Existing Habits

### ☀️ Sunscreen

Apply sunscreen to my face and neck each day.

#### Why?

Do you remember glow-in-the-dark toys? I am whiter than those. The new brightness settings on the iPhone Pro models could leave me with a sunburn.

I do my best to avoid the sun at all cost, but that robs me of many of the joys of [living in Portugal](https://blog.samrhea.com/tag/portugal). My wife, who has southern Mediterranean roots, bronzes and wants me to join her at the beach or on an *esplanade* from time-to-time.

She also knows that every older, male member of my family has a chunk of his nose removed at some point due to skin cancer and I am likely doomed to that fate if I do not take better care of myself. This is my compromise habit.

#### What stopped me from hitting 100%?

* Oversleeping - I'll be late starting my day and rush out the door without this step.
* Poor calendar planning - I'll work out in the morning and not bother to apply sunscreen and then skip this if I figure that I'll just be inside working for most of the rest of the day.
* Carcinogens? - I promise I am not a conspiracy theorist, I have all my vaccines etc, but the goofy bubble of tech-bro-podcasts that I live in started to caution against sunscreens that do not use zinc oxide and so I paused for a few days while I found one.

### 🚰 Drinking Water

Drink 2.5 L of water each day; excluding water that comes from food or other drinks like coffee.

#### Why?

Portugal is warm! And we're outside a lot! Not only that, but water in restaurants is not a default and is served in expensive bottles. How is everyone not dehyrdated on this continent?

I also sometimes did that pandemic meme thing of hitting a point in the evening where wine met coffee in my stomach and asked "hey, have you seen water?"

#### What stopped me from hitting 100%?

* I made this a priority and it worked out.

### ✍️ Writing

Write for 20 minutes each day excluding writing I do for work.

#### Why?

I really enjoy writing for personal reasons and think about it like a muscle that needs exercise.

#### What stopped me from hitting 100%?

* Laziness - this is the easiest thing to cut because I'll start to get busy with work or chores or physical exercise.

### 🇵🇹 Practice Portuguese

Spend 30 minutes each day practicing Portuguese.

#### Why?

I live in Portugal. I have lived in Portugal for nearly four years. My wife speaks Portuguese, works at a Portuguese company, and frequently works in Portuguese. Mine is dismal.

#### What stopped me from hitting 100%?

* Travel - like Q1, I spent a lot of time on the road and that always means I feel less motivated to keep pursuing Portuguese.
* Laziness - similar to writing, this would be one of the first things that I'd chuck overboard when days would get busy.

### 📵 No Phone in Bed

Go to bed without a device that contains the sum total of human knowledge in my hand as I fall asleep on it.

#### Why?

I waste at least 30 minutes each evening when I should be sleeping and instead scroll Marvel and Austin subreddits or the Twitter "For You" section.

#### What stopped me from hitting 100%?

* Weekends - I tend to really drop off (and you can see this in the chart) on the weekend when I am less concerned about waking up early in the morning.

### 💪 100 Push Ups

Knock out 100 push ups each day.

#### Why?

Mostly to just see if I can. I already work out pretty conistently; I run 4 miles 3 times per week and lift weights another 3 days. I just like that this one forces me to start my day being active.

#### What stopped me from hitting 100%?

* Later - this was my absolute best streak until I decided to postpone getting it done one day, forgot, and went to bed only to wake up realizing I had broken my streak. And then the act of breaking it once made it easier to skip a couple more times and suddenly it starts to fade. I need to make this a priority as soon as I wake up.
