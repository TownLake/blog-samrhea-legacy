> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list - mostly so I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I flew across the Atlantic Ocean 22 times last year. Only 4 of those 11 distinct trips involved direct flights from Lisbon to my final destination. I spent a lot of time bored in airports. On one of those trips I strolled through the Book People store in the Austin airport searching for something to read on my AUS-EWR-LIS route, at least until I could sleep on the EWR-LIS leg. I saw this and grabbed it having read clippings of it in the news and I figured I could chew through it.

I put this book down frequently and read other things. I wound up clocking in at 7 months from start to finish. The book spends the last ~20% covering the Biden campaign and I struggled to keep paying attention. I know, I know - that part is supposed to be the uplifting third act that restores democracy. Shameful as this is, I mostly picked up the book to revisit the chaos.
