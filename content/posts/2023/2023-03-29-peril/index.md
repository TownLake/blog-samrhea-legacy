> ## Not a Book Report
> I enjoy [reflecting](https://blog.samrhea.com/posts/2019/analyze-media-habits) on the movies, TV, books and other media that I consume. I'm notoriously sentimental. This [series](https://blog.samrhea.com/category/walkthrough) documents the books that I read. These aren't reviews or recommendations. Just a list. For me. Mostly so that I can page through what I read, where I was, and when.

## Why did I read it?
I flew across the Atlantic Ocean 22 times last year. Only 4 of those 11 distinct trips involved direct flights from Lisbon to my final destination. I spent a lot of time bored in airports. On one of those trips I strolled through the Book People store in the Austin airport searching for something to read on my AUS-EWR-LIS route, at least until I could sleep on the EWR-LIS leg. I saw this and grabbed it having read clippings of it in the news and I figured I could chew through it.

## Notes - No Spoilers
* We have such short attention spans! Several events covered in this book, like the "upside down Bible military march to that church", are things that I had almost forgotten. The entire time I read this book was mostly me just muttering "oh God, yeah, that happened too."
* Some moments of the book were downright terrifying to revisit. We were so close to squandering the Experiment. What scares me now is the subtitle of this post - feels like we forgot that. Or, maybe we didn't, but some decided to forget it.
* Watching many of these scenes from Portugal felt so weird at the time and reading this book, again mostly in Portugal, still feels odd. A strange survivor's guilt. I was living this idyllic existence in a beautiful European country while a far right blowhard in horns and furs stood at the podium in Congress.
* I remember being on a call with a coworker as January 6th unfoled and we just wrapped up the meeting - we couldn't focus on the work while we watched the Capitol under siege. The play-by-play in this book kept reminding me of how jaw dropping that evening felt.
* I put this book down frequently and read other things. I wound up clocking in at 7 months from start to finish. The book spends the last ~20% covering the Biden campaign and I struggled to keep paying attention. I know, I know - that part is supposed to be the uplifting third act that restores democracy. And I'm someone who had a teacher from my high school in Texas call my mom to warn her that I was a democrat! Shameful as this is, I mostly picked up the book to revisit the chaos.
